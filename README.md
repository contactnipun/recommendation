# Product Recommendation System  
  
# Domain - E-commerce    

# Context  
Everyday a million products are being recommended to users based on popularity and other metrics on e-commerce websites. The most popular e-commerce website boosts average order value by 50%, increases revenues by 300%, and improves conversion. In addition to being a powerful tool for increasing revenues, product recommendations are so essential that customers now expect to see similar features on all other eCommerce sites.  
# Source  
Amazon Reviews data (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) The repository has several datasets. For this project, we are using the Electronics dataset.  
  
# Objective  
To make a recommendation system that recommends at least five(5) new products based on the user's habits.  
    
# Steps and tasks    
1. Read and explore the given dataset. ( Rename column/add headers, plot histograms, find data characteristics)  
2. Take a subset of the dataset to make it less sparse/ denser. ( For example, keep the users only who has given 50 or more number of ratings )  
3. Build Popularity Recommender model.  
4. Split the data randomly into a train and test dataset.  
5. Build Collaborative Filtering model.  
6. Get top - K ( K = 5) recommendations. Since our goal is to recommend new products to each user based on his/her habits, we will recommend 5 new products.
